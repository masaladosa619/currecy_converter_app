here i will write all the deinations
there are three types of widgets:
1)statless
in this once a widget is created it never changes meaning it does not have any state its immutable
2)stateful
its the widget that can change over time and it has a state that can be changed exact opposite of stateless 
3)inherited

first of all whats state:
state is the data that can change over time its something that our widget cares about

there are two types of design patterns in flutter:
material design created by google
cupertino design  created by apple


to return a text in maetrial we can use the home widget(it is a widget that is used to create the home screen of the app)
in home theres a property called scaffold
scaffold is a widget that provides a structure for the visual interface of the app
now to bring the text in the centre we can use the center widget in the scaffold
to bring the text in the center we can use the center widget in the scaffold in center we use the child property to bring the text in the center

okay so like agar humko code proper way mai rakhne hai to hum haar function ke liye ek alag file bana sakte hai
to create a new file we can right click on the lib folder and then click on new file

class CurrecnyConverterMaterialpage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CurrecnyConverterMaterialpage({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(body: Center(child: Text("mera khel khatam haiðŸ¥€")
    )
    );
  }
}
ye jo humne class banayi hai isko hum ek widget tree kehte hai isme humne ek widget banaya hai jo ki ek stateless widget hai abb widget tree chhota hona chaiye so that readability badh sake
to isliye humne ek alag file banayi hai jisme humne widget banaya

also jo BuildContext hai uske baare mai thoda jaan lete hai
so yeh BuildContext kya hai
BuildContext is an object that provides information about the location of a widget in the widget tree. so that widget ko pata reh ki phele scaffold hai and uske andar center hai and uske andar text hai


abb so agar hume bohot saare widgets ko align karan hai to hum column widget ka use kar sakte hai
column widget is a widget that allows us to arrange multiple widgets vertically in a column

now for taking input in a app we use textfield 
also there is a property called inputdecoration which is used to like make decorations for the text we will input

two types of buttons used in flutter are 
raised : one which actually liiks like a button this is also known as elevated button in flutter 
used like a text : one which looks like text but is actually a button and this is text button in flutter

so () {} this is a anonymous function so like iska kuch naam wagera nahi hota hai isse isliye use karte hai ki bhai we are declaring a function here
